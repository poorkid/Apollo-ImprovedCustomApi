## Features
- Use Apollo for Reddit with your own Reddit and Imgur API keys
- Working Imgur integration (view, delete, and upload single images and multi-image albums) 
- Handle x.com links as Twitter links so that they can be opened in the Twitter app
- Suppress unwanted messages on app startup (wallpaper popup, in-app announcements, etc)
- Support new share link format (reddit.com/r/subreddit/s/xxxxxx) so they open like any other post and not in a browser
- Support media share links (reddit.com/media?url=)
- **Fully working** "New Comments Highlightifier" Ultra feature
- Randomize "trending subreddits list" so it doesn't show **iOS**, **Clock**, **Time**, **IfYouDontMind** all the time
- Use generic user agent for requests to Reddit
- Support FLEX debugging

## Known issues
- Apollo Ultra features may cause app to crash 
- Imgur multi-image upload
    - Uploads usually fail on the first attempt but subsequent retries should succeed
- Share URLs in private messages and long-tapping them still open in the in-app browser
